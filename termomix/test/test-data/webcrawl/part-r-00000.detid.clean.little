november | 2010 | voices from russia voices from russia tuesday  30 november 2010 30 november 2010  a picture is worth a thousand wordsâ€¦ leninâ€™s 140th birthdayÂ markedâ€¦ filed under: history   russian   soviet period â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 thereâ€™s a new appreciation of vladimir ilyich arising in contemporary russia  itâ€™s disconcerting to many westerners  but itâ€™s nothing but a realisation that 75 years of russian history cannot be blithely tossed in the dustbin just like that  the only people silly enough to urge us to do that are american suburbanites  we shall not spit on the great victory  on the great literacy campaign  or on the extension of basic health care throughout the country  we will not deny lenin  stalin  khrushchyov  and gorbachyovâ€¦ they were real historical figures  like them or not  russians now realise that our post 1917 history is made up of intertwined red and white threads that are so interwoven that we would do harm if we tried to separate them  russia livedâ€¦ russia livesâ€¦ russia shall live! bmd comments off tyumen businessman sentenced to probation for â€œbeautifyingâ€ a statue of lenin with a star ofÂ david filed under: jewish   legal   politics   russian â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 statue of v  i  lenin (1870 1924) in tyumen in western siberia  if you wanna be an anti semite in russiaâ€¦ thatâ€™s not okâ€¦ john law will get yaâ€¦                                the justice of the peace for the central okrug of tyumen convicted local businessman georgi zarubin of vandalism  according to a report on tuesday from the press service of the tyumen oblast prokuratura  â€œearly in the morning of 26 april  mr zarubin  a lawyer by profession  wrote the word â€œÑ‚ÐµÑ€Ñ€Ð¾Ñ€Ð¸ÑÑ‚â€ (terrorist) in white paint on a monument to lenin in the centre of tyumen accompanied with a star of david  on 12 june  russia day  at about 16 00  he publicly committed a similar actionâ€  the statement said  the court found mr zarubin guilty under article 214 part 2 of the rf criminal code (vandalism motivated by political  ideological  ethnic  or religious hatred and enmity) and sentenced him to two years of probation  during this period  mr zarubin has to report three times a month to the authorities  heâ€™s prohibited from attending mass public events  and he isnâ€™t allowed to change his place of residence without permission  30 november 2010 interfax   religion      interfax religion ru ?act=news&div=38467 comments off patriarch kirill demanded that the usa lift the economic blockade of cubaÂ immediately filed under: christian   church in society   diplomacy   moscow patriarchate   orthodox hierarchs   patriarch kirill gundyaev   politics   religious   russian   usa â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 patriarch kirill gundyaev of moscow and all the russias (1946  )  with cuban president raÃºl modesto castro ruz (1931  ) in moscow  his holiness has stated his position clearlyâ€¦ neoliberal â€œconservatismâ€ and â€œfree marketâ€ capitalism are fraudulent  those who try to link orthodoxy to such extremists as rush limbaugh and sarah palin should stopâ€¦ they are not in step with the church                                 patriarch kirill gundyaev of moscow and all the russias condemned the american economic blockade of cuba as unjust  â€œwe recognise that cuba is in difficult economic straits due to the economic blockade  we have repeatedly said that the [american] blockade of cuba is utterly unjustâ€  his holiness said at a meeting with ricardo alarcÃ³n de quesada  the president of theÂ national assembly of peopleâ€™s power of cuba  vladyki kirill believes that such a blockade â€œdoesnâ€™t correspond to the political and economic realities of the 21st century  itâ€™s nothing but a vestige of the cold war  and itâ€™s very important that we remove this useless relic as quickly as possible from the international arena  cuba has shown the world that she can live under an economic blockade  but thereâ€™s no reason why cuba canâ€™t live like any other state  free to trade with whomever it pleases  to develop whatever bilateral contacts that it will with the outside worldâ€  his holiness believes that the cubans  who â€œsuffered so much throughout their history  now bravely defend their independence and their right to build their lives on an equitable basisâ€  in turn  sr alarcÃ³n thanked the patriarch for his â€œgenerous words regarding the economic situation caused by the confrontational attitude of the united states  the cuban people have proven that they can survive under siege  but  in truth  itâ€™s a very hard thing to do  in our country  millions of people sufferâ€  in reply  the patriarch pointed up that christianity unites both countries  and said that that the moscow patriarchate serves the russian orthodox christians who live in cuba  of whom there are several thousand  he thanked the cuban government for its assistance in building a russian orthodox parish church in havana  which is a religious and social centre for the resident russians  ukrainians  byelorussians  and moldovans  patriarch kirill assured sr alarcÃ³n of the readiness of the moscow patriarchate to promote the strengthening of russian cuban relations  he was glad that the mp could contribute to the restoration of relations between the ophthalmologic centre in havana and the fyodorov institute of ophthalmologic microsurgery in moscow  30 november 2010 interfax religion      interfax religion ru ?act=news&div=38476 editorâ€™s note: his holiness has spoken  all good orthodox christians should put it to the gopâ€¦ â€œabandon the blockade or we abandon youâ€  thereâ€™s no middle course  truly  let me reiterate  thereâ€™s no common ground between holy orthodoxy and the neoliberal â€œconservativeâ€ movement  none whatsoever  neoliberalism preaches a soulless and godless worship of mammon  and we all know what our lord christ said on that  donâ€™t let their smarmy sectarian rhetoric fool youâ€¦ look at joe miller! a christian gentleman and patriot would have conceded the election  but power and greed rule this monstrous excuse for a human beingâ€¦ just as it moves all of the elected officials affiliated with the tea party  you can stand with his holiness or you can stand with the tea partyâ€¦ thatâ€™s the choice  clear and simple  iâ€™ve chosenâ€¦ what about you? bmd comments off video  a musical compare and contrast: the turetsky choir and celticÂ thunder filed under: uncategorized â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 hereâ€™s some vids from two contemporary male choruses who use the pop idiom  i find many similaritiesâ€¦ do you? bmd ****** turetsky choir ****** celtic thunder ****** turetsky choir ****** celtic thunder ****** hereâ€™s a bonus trackâ€¦ the peresvet chorus singing at an orthodox concert dedicated to ss pyotr and fevronia (a day to honour the family) ****** hereâ€™s a double bonusâ€¦ itâ€™s a little hoot from the turetsky choirâ€¦ orthodox people will especially see the spoofâ€¦ itâ€™s harmless funâ€¦ smile awhileâ€¦ god will bless you for it  did you catch the glimpse of the bishop applauding as loudly as all the rest? ****** comments off next page Â» blog stats 7 722 415 hits november 2010 m t w t f s s Â« oct Â  dec Â» 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

                               a few people have asked me the particulars of zoya kosmodemyanskaya  as they had never heard of her  all we russians know her storyâ€¦ she was one of the great heroines of the vov  in june 1941  zoya was an 18 year old high school student  when the fascist forces approached moscow  zoya volunteered to fight with the partisans behind german lines  her mother protested  but zoya persisted  so her mum relented  on 27 november 1941  zoyaâ€™s unit infiltrated through the german lines into the occupied zone  her assignment was to burn stables in the village of petrishchevo  which was occupied by an enemy cavalry unit  monument to zoya in the partizanskaya metro station in moscow                               video in honour of zoya kosmodemyanskaya  entitled a prayer for a young communist   the music is by zhanna bichevskaya  lord  have mercy the fascists captured her on 28 november  they beat her unmercifully  but she refused to tell them anything  the next morning  the fascists led her through the village  then  they hung her as an example to others  before they killed her  zoya said  â€œyou can hang me now  but iâ€™m not alone  there are two hundred million of us  you canâ€™t hang us allâ€  zoya received the title of hero of the soviet union posthumously  by the way  when soviet military records were declassified in the early 2000s  it became clear that vasili klubkov  one of her comrades in the unit  betrayed zoya to the fascists  he was seeking rehabilitation for his post war sentence to the gulagâ€¦ naturally enough  when this came out  his petition was denied (there is justice in the world)  aleksandr kosmodemyansky (1925 45)                                not only was zoya a decorated hero of the vov  so was her brother  after her death  he petitioned to join the red army  but they turned him down because he was too young  in mid 1942  he was accepted as an officer candidate  and he went to the front in 1943  he was killed leading an attack as the commander of a unit of su 152 assault guns in the heavy fighting in the vicinity of kÃ¶nigsberg in east prussia  he  too  received the title of hero of the soviet union  brother and sister are buried near one another in the novodevichy cemetery in moscow  you can see why wonderful and courageous people like this are antipodes apart from worthless and money grubbing scum like sarah palin  glenn beck  and rush limbaugh  you cannot honour both  you must choose one or the other  i choose to honour the courage of our heroes rather than worship filthy lucre and oppress my fellows for the sake of more dollars in my bank account  as palin  beck  and limabaugh doâ€¦ itâ€™s quite that simple  what about you? barbara marie drezhlo friday 10 december 2010 albany ny editorâ€™s postscript: this proves that john whiteford must remove the link to the extremist website  palintology   from his website  otherwise  he tells the world that he does not worship christâ€¦ in that case  he worships almighty mammon and he shamelessly sucks up to sectarian scummers  for what benefit  god only knows  the loudmouth konvertsy have seized the internet forumâ€¦ itâ€™s time for us to take it back from them! theyâ€™re giving the world the impression that orthodoxy approves of the most wicked and evil streams in american politicsâ€¦ when the very opposite is the actual case  there can be no concord between orthodoxy and the tea party  or the neocons  or the right wing of the republican partyâ€¦ call it what you will  follow the moneyâ€¦ follow his holiness  not feckless lilâ€™ miss sarah and two ton rush!

11 | december | 2010 | voices from russia voices from russia saturday  11 december 2010 11 december 2010  â€œproshu k stolu!â€ thatâ€™s â€œgood eatsâ€ in russianâ€¦ spicyÂ aubergines filed under: domestic life   food and cooking   russian â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 this weekend  i just wanted to do a simple little post with aubergines  itâ€™ll come in handy  and itâ€™s good  besides  we call them tankina auberginesâ€¦ why do we call them tankinas and not just â€œspicy aubergines?â€ thatâ€™s because tankina is the name of my wifeâ€™s friend  and they always treat us with these lovelies whenever weâ€™re in odessaâ€¦ always to great cheers! i already did a post about them along time ago  but it wasnâ€™t a step by step and detailed recipeâ€¦ thereâ€™s nothing complicated in this recipe at all  hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need: 2 5 kilos (5 5 pounds) aubergine (eggplant) 1 25 kilos (2 75 pounds) red capsicums (bell peppers) 75 grammes (>3 ounces) hot red chilli peppers 75 grammes (>3 ounces) garlic 125 millilitres (1 2 cup) vinegar chop up the capsicums  garlic  and chilli pepper roughly  and pass them through a food mill or put them in the food processor  mince them up roughly  and add the vinegar to the mass  and mix it in thoroughly  you can cut up the aubergines as you will  this time  i did it this wayâ€¦ fry them up  you donâ€™t need to use a lot of oil  and season them with salt and pepper  after theyâ€™re done  slather the prepared sauce over them  and place them carefully in a bowl  but do note that in my experience these hold for a week at most  however  donâ€™t worry; theyâ€™ll be all eaten up quicklyâ€¦ cover the bowl with clingfilm and let it sit at least overnight in the fridgeâ€¦ after you do that  youâ€™ll begin to notice that the value of the average number of openings of the icebox increases exponentially  these go well with chilled vodka and dill pickles  and you can also add garlic  dill  horseradish  ginger root  and hot red pepperâ€¦  itâ€™s really just a simple appetizer; your glass will try to jump into the dish with it  itâ€™s no trouble at all to whip upâ€¦ so  we added crisp toasted bread rounds and accompanied it with herring on black bread  well  now that the spicy eggplants are ready  you can safely begin with a jigger of chilled spirits  bringing forth memories of those who gave you lifeâ€¦ Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸ÑÑ‚Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð°Ð¿Ð¿ÐµÑ‚Ð¸Ñ‚Ð°  bon appÃ©tit  youâ€™ll enjoy these aubergines  mmm  mosfood : ÐºÑƒÐ»Ð¸Ð½Ð°Ñ€Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹ Ð¿Ð¾Ñ€Ñ‚Ð°Ð»    mosfoodnews ru baklazhany ostrye recept s foto 122 html comments off 11 december

Â christianityÂ hangs on in chinaâ€¦ the worst of the persecutions are over  thereâ€™s no longer a â€œcultural revolutionâ€  this looks like a catholic chapel of some sort  the russian website labelled it as a proddie churchâ€¦ but i doubt thatâ€¦ thereâ€™s a rosary and sacred heart  after all  none of us have this to faceâ€¦ soâ€¦ quit yer bitchinâ€™  we donâ€™t face persecution or state control  yet we cower in the corner whenever a lebedeff or behr or stokoe issues yet another loud coverup and lie  ura! for the chinese believers! the orthodox believers in the west get the soggy

russian â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 in the town of zlatoust in chelyabinsk oblast  a mother  a member of a well known and notorious sect  severely abused her teenage daughter for her so called â€œsinsâ€; now  the girl is now safely in a rehab centre  â€œmy mum beat me with whatever was at handâ€¦ she used a rope [as a whip]  a stick [as a club]  she struck me all overâ€¦ on my head; all over my bodyâ€¦ she even locked me naked in the cellar for several hours  i was warned not to say anything about it to my classmates and friendsâ€  according to the 13 year old schoolgirl victim quoted by the newspaper ÐºÐ¾Ð¼ÑÐ¾Ð¼Ð¾Ð»ÑŒÑÐºÐ°Ñ Ð¿Ñ€Ð°Ð²Ð´Ð° (komsomolskaya pravda  â€œkpâ€) on thursday  according to a spokesman for the zlatoust city court  the woman forced the girl to memorise religious texts  so called â€œmantrasâ€ (a set of words  the repetition of which  according to the sectâ€™s â€œleaderâ€  leads to eternal happiness: interfax )  and forbade her to eat meat  the prokuratura brought a criminal case against the woman  and the rehabilitation centre backed her daughterâ€™s account  but her mother wouldnâ€™t let the affair rest  up to the present  sheâ€™s hung around the shelter and stalked her daughter at school  the mother demanded that her daughter return home and badgered her to repudiate her testimony  which caused a scandal  and drove her daughter to tears  according to the court  the mother justified herself by saying that she was just dealing with a disobedient daughter  and she dealt out a few slaps  she said that her daughter wasnâ€™t exemplary in her conduct  for she stole money and broke things in the house  however  the mother didnâ€™t deny her guilt and promised to seek psychological help  if her daughter was returned to her  the court abridged the womanâ€™s parental rights; she has to meet her daughter in a controlled setting at the rehabilitation centre  if  during this time  the mother doesnâ€™t reform and doesnâ€™t regain her daughterâ€™s trust  sheâ€™ll be prohibited from contacting the child  the court decision hasnâ€™t yet entered into legal force; it may yet be appealed  â€œthis womanâ€™s behaviour is nothing out of the ordinary for sects; itâ€™s typical of the aggressive behaviour found in sectarian adherents  theyâ€™re organisations imbued with fanaticism; they provoke people to act like theyâ€™re mentally disorderedâ€  konstantin putnik  deputy director of the missionary department of the diocese of chelyabinsk  said in comments on the behaviour of the mother  he pitied the girl  â€œsheâ€™s of an age when the psyche is very vulnerable to damage from violence from people belonging to extremist sects  who often have a crankish system of moral parametersâ€  he said  9 december 2010 interfax  religion      interfax religion ru ?act=news&div=38612 editorâ€™s note: thereâ€™s a reason why the russian government is leery of sectariansâ€¦ they have cultish and odd behaviour  and children are often hurt by them  as this court case illustrates  thereâ€™s a reason why mark stokoe hates the russian governmentâ€™s vigorous actions against the excesses of the sects  a sectarian cabal has infiltrated and contaminated the upper reaches of the ocaâ€¦ just look at dubious sorts such as the hoomies and matthew tateâ€¦ and the smirky toleration of isidore brittain and seraphim storheim  god willing  the canadian court will move relatively quickly  and find storheim guilty  then  we can move against the konvertsy and burn them out  root and branch  theyâ€™re a cancerâ€¦ you donâ€™t compromise with a cancerâ€¦ you kill it  utterly and without mercy  thatâ€™s what we have to doâ€¦ and do it thoroughly and without emotion  converts will have to chooseâ€¦ they can have the real church of the ages with all of its quirks and imperfections or they can have an illusionary phantasmic golem ginned up by delusionary former sectarians and episkies  it shanâ€™t be easyâ€¦ choose well  the fate of your immortal soul does depend on it  bmd comments off next page Â» blog stats 7 722 191 hits december 2010 m t w t f s s Â« nov Â  jan Â» Â  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

15 | december | 2010 | voices from russia voices from russia wednesday  15 december 2010 some advice from an old hand on how to survive the coming storm from the storheimÂ affair filed under: canada   christian   metropolitan jonas paffhausen   moral issues   religious   rocor   usa â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 of course  many are talking about the much bruited rocor oca lovefest being touted on the official websites of both bodies  of course  one sees a great deal of thunder rumbling  lightning flashes  and showy spectacles  in short  itâ€™s â€œmuch ado signifying nothingâ€  this didnâ€™t come from an organic and natural growthâ€¦ it came from the clerical bureaucracies of both groupsâ€¦ theyâ€™re scared shitless of the storheim affair and how it will influence the oca  hereâ€™s what i wrote to a priest friend: letâ€™s keep it simpleâ€¦ lebedeff is scared that victims of rocor paedophiles will come out  if you lie about your pastâ€¦ this is what happens  as i wrote yesterday  this is no surprise  itâ€™s been coming for some time  all this will do is roil the potâ€¦ which may well be necessary  donâ€™t say anything openlyâ€¦ lebedeffâ€™s a nasty sort  do speak up in privateâ€¦ but do protect yourself  i can be a mme plasâ€¦ it would beÂ disastrousÂ for you  the apparatchiki are scared shitless by the storheim caseâ€¦ theyâ€™re afraid of a revolt by the unwashed  and  let me tell you  the rocor ethnic faithful and the oca ethnic faithful are still tightâ€¦ as they well should be  both the oca and rocor apparats are hiding a great deal of nastiness  itâ€™s not only the terrible trio of podmoshensky  greene  and metropoulosâ€¦ there was a hushed up scandal at holy trinity seminary in jordanville in the 80sâ€¦ the cleric involved was sent off to the mountain  i believe  in the oca  it wasnâ€™t merely the three gay bladesâ€¦ lazor  lâ€™huillier  and soraichâ€¦ what about peterson and paffhausen celebrating liturgy alongside isidore brittain  who was supposedly suspended for naughty doings? that is  thereâ€™s a great deal of stuff that both sides are attempting to stuff down the memory hole  a third party told me that paffhausen attempted to gag kristi kumentakos with a directive to â€œforgive and forgetâ€â€¦ that is  â€œpay  pray  and obeyâ€  and he had the consummate gall to try to order her to keep it secret  this jackass is forever braying about â€œtransparencyâ€ and â€œopennessâ€â€¦ and he secretly threatens people  donâ€™t you dare send your goons after kristi  fathausenâ€¦ she didnâ€™t breathe a word to meâ€¦ and donâ€™t you dare go after her father  you posturing pos  he didnâ€™t say a thing either  your actions are rather notorious now  and all sorts of people are watching you  câ€™mon  you were asked to investigate seraphim storheim a year ago  and you refused  this should teach all of you out there a lesson  for the time beingâ€¦ donâ€™t trust either oca or rocor priests  and donâ€™t tell â€˜em anything that you wouldnâ€™t want publicised  fathausen has refused to punish velencia for his spilling of the beans from counselling  and thatâ€™s the same as blabbing confessional secrets (the law thinks so)  i donâ€™t like saying this  but sad experience has taught me that most priests are weak men  they arenâ€™t evil or badâ€¦ theyâ€™re only weak reeds  however  most of the wickedness done in this fallen world is the result of weakness in the face of power  not deliberate evil or conscious nastiness  there are bad bishops such as paffhausen and peterson out there (they did openly concelebrate with the suspended clergyman isidore brittain  after all)  these men stop at nothingâ€¦ they have no scruplesâ€¦ they threaten people in secret (as do some archpriests and hieromonks as well)  this rot is pervasive in both the rocor and oca upper reachesâ€¦ be careful what you say to a priest  a given priest may wish to keep a confidence  but crook bishops and archpriests have ways of getting weak priests to spill the goodies  never underestimate the power of â€œthe good of the churchâ€  if the average priest were given the choice  heâ€™d spill what you told him in preference to losing his situation or rank  iâ€™m not telling you to hate priests; iâ€™m not telling you that theyâ€™re rottersâ€¦ iâ€™m telling you to be circumspect until this mess finds a resolution  thatâ€™s how low weâ€™ve fallen  thatâ€™s what makes the current dance of the spinmeisters on the official websites so macabre and twisted  well  we know something nowâ€¦ theyâ€™re all the same under the skin  and they all wish to hold on to power at all costs  take heart  it wonâ€™t last foreverâ€¦ itâ€™ll just feel that way  i remember what a local in richfield springs ny told me about the jordanville monastery  â€œthey lost their reason for being in â€™91 when the commies fell  and they havenâ€™t found anything yet to replace itâ€  svs syosset has been headless since the death of ads  today  these two apparats are just self perpetuating cabalsâ€¦ itâ€™s sad  isnâ€™t it? i remember the 80s and 90sâ€¦ none of us thought that it would end like thisâ€¦ in mutual moral bankruptcy and mutual defence of moral turpitude that would make a hardened odessa thief hurl in disgust  itâ€™s never boring in orthodoxy in americaâ€¦ do pass me the jug  rememberâ€¦ donâ€™t tell a priest anything that you donâ€™t want the whole world to know  thatâ€™s how bad itâ€™s gottenâ€¦ remember  raymond velencia still remains unpunished and he remains a priest (defended by jp and lebedeff  dontcha know)  barbara marie drezhlo wednesday 15 december 2010 albany ny comments off patriarch irinej gavriloviÄ‡ of serbia: â€œcommunist crimes werenâ€™t equal to theÂ holocaustâ€ filed under: christian   history   jewish   orthodox hierarchs   religious   serbia â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 his holiness irinej gavriloviÄ‡  archbishopÂ ofÂ peÄ‡ Â metropolitanÂ ofÂ belgradeÂ andÂ karlovci  and patriarch of all serbia (1930  )                                patriarch irinej gavriloviÄ‡  the first hierarch of the serbian orthodox church (spc) says he is against any equating of german nazi crimes with those committed by communists in former yugoslavia  â€œwithout justifying execution without a trial  we canâ€™t equalise between that kind of terror and the holocaustâ€  patriarch irinej told the holocaust seminar at the assembly of vojvodina in novi sad  in his view  the stand of traditional churches towards the holocaust was quite clear and unambiguous  when it comes to that historical truth  he said that it was true that the communist authorities of former yugoslavia killed people without putting them on trial â€œin the wake of world war iiâ€  but he added there were records showing that some of those executed  apart from innocent victims  were those who were directly involved in nazi formations that committed crimes against jews  serbs  and others Â vladyki irinej stated that we should deal with this issue â€œwith cautionâ€  but added that the second world war didnâ€™t happen â€œin the distant past  obscured by myths and legendsâ€  but that the facts about what happened during the war and immediately afterwards can be established  he said that when anti semitic texts started appearing in serbia  the late patriarch pavle stojÄeviÄ‡ severely criticised that occurrence and addressed a letter to the jewish municipality of belgrade clearly stating the spcâ€™s stand and condemning anti semitism Â â€œon the other hand  we donâ€™t have a mechanism to prevent certain extreme individuals and groups from presenting themselves as authentic christians  and disseminating their vague doctrines  which can lead to the repeating of crimesâ€  irinej warned  and he added  â€œthose occurrences must be separated from the official stand of the church on the holocaustâ€ Â vladyki irinej also noted that some serbian orthodox monasteries were sanctuaries for persecuted jews  who hid there dressed as monks before they went to villages to stay with peasants who offered them protection Â irinej said that this and other examples should be remembered and talked and written about  â€œjust like the examples of (nazi) soldiers who refused to commit nazi crimes although they knew that it would cost them their livesâ€  there were several such cases during the novi sad raid  in january 1942  he said  his holiness noted that  in serbia  the german occupation forces carried out the holocaust  especially the gestapo special police force  not the puppet government in serbia  which was tolerated by the germans Â â€œiâ€™m not saying that there werenâ€™t any individuals who participated in those crimesâ€  he added Â he expressed his admiration for jerusalemâ€™s yad vashem holocaust memorial  which works to record the names of all holocaust victims  and he warned that  amongst serbs  the culture of remembrance wasnâ€™t always kept at a high level  â€œand thatâ€™s why we sometimes easily forget our own and other victims Â that was why we didnâ€™t have a list of the victims of the second world war  as well as the victims of the wars before and after thatâ€ Â the jewish municipality of novi sad and the simon wiesenthal centre from jerusalem  under the sponsorship of sÃ¡ndor egeresi  the president of the assembly the autonomous province of vojvodina  organised the seminar  after the seminar  the participants visited the monument to the victims of the january 1942 massacre  when hungarian fascist forces killed and threw into the danube more than 1 300 jews  serbs  and roma Â some researchers suggest that more than 2 000 novi sad residents perished in the murderous rampage that is known as the novi sad raid  15 december 2010 b92      b92 net eng news society article php?yyyy=2010&mm=12&dd=15&nav id=71535 comments off a multimedia presentation  christmas 2010 is coming soonâ€¦ enjoy it whilst itâ€™sÂ here! filed under: christian   christmas   domestic life   popular life and customs   social life and customs â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 how about a jaunt to germany?

bmd ****** angela merkel acknowledged that attempts to integrate migrants into german society have failedâ€¦ german bundeskanzlerin angela merkel said  â€œthe attempt to build a multicultural society in a single country is a complete failureâ€  she made this unexpected revelation at a meeting of the youth organisation of the christian democratic union (cdu) in potsdam  â€œin the early sixties  our country invited foreign workers to come here  and now they live here  for some time  weâ€™ve been deceiving ourselves  saying  â€˜they wonâ€™t be here for good  someday  theyâ€™ll leaveâ€™  but this didnâ€™t happen  of course  we tied our approach to multiculturalism  that we would live together and appreciate each other  however  that has failed  utterly failedâ€  bundeskanzlerin merkel noted  the migrantsâ€™ children  born in germany  should adapt to german society  she explained  â€œwe donâ€™t want those who donâ€™t speak german to stay here  because  if they donâ€™t  they wouldnâ€™t be able to become full participants in the labour marketâ€  germans rightly noticed that  recently  frau merkel stigmatised thilo sarrazin  a freelance journalist and economist  author of the controversial bestseller deutschland schafft sich ab (germany does away with itself)  for political incorrectness  then  in fact  she took him aside  repeating almost word for word the accusations of the spd that herr sarrazin was a heretic  his book sparked off a debate about migrants and islamic culture in germany  it rages on with renewed vigour  however  the germans were not the first  the french are still arguing about banning the burqa  a move that has much support both in france and in belgium  and the peaceful and tolerant swiss mountaineers suddenly rose up against the building of minarets  this massive influx of illegal migrants flows into old europe over all national borders  fears amongst germans were fanned by law enforcement reports of an islamist underground movement  widely spread out right under very noses of the peaceful burghers  loud islamic radicals  many of whom hold german passports  go to afghanistan to fight the â€œinfidelsâ€ and some are even complicit in the 11 september attacks in new york  not surprisingly  bundesprÃ¤sident christian wulff hurried to give his viewpoint  on 3 october  on the day of german unity  he gave a keynote speech in which he declared that islam had become an integral part of germany  thus  herr wulff shocked many fellow citizens  especially conservatives  on the other hand  liberals were indignant at a declaration made by horst seehofer  ministerprÃ¤sident of bavaria and leader of the csu  he stated  â€œmulticulturalism is dead in germany  and the indigenous population and migrants canâ€™t live in peace togetherâ€  and called for the suspension of turkish and arab immigration to germany  perhaps  the incarnate symbol of national discord is a star player on the german national football team  mesut Ã¶zil  a third generation ethnic turk who was born and raised in germany  at the final match of the uefa euro 2012 qualifying round in berlin against turkey  he scored a goal against the turkish side than earned him the wrath of the turkish fans in the stands  by the way  these turks were also german citizens  ****** what did you think of that? alexander rahr  german political scientist: a few weeks ago  a banker  thilo sarrazin  published a sensational book about the â€œcultural declineâ€ of germany  then  he was stigmatised and demonised in every way  suddenly  it turned out  sarrazin was right about some things  we donâ€™t have â€œmultikultiâ€  rather  we have a big problem  and the bundeskanzlerin recognised it  today  frau merkel seems to be rocking to and fro  because no one knows where sheâ€™s leading her party  now  sheâ€™s doing what she must to keep the more conservative elements in the cdu  however  certainly  this isnâ€™t the only problem  today  germans understand that a subculture has formed in our country that can undermine the foundations on of german society  officially  we have 5 6 million muslim residents  of course  today  migration flows are much smaller than they were in the 90s  unfortunately  those people here now who came from islamic countries have refused to assimilate  they created their own enclaves  they donâ€™t teach the german language to their kids  and they arenâ€™t subject to german law  itâ€™s clear that some of them are engaged in terrorist activities  this problem was long ignored  for  over the last 30 years  itâ€™s been the fashion to protect the rights of various minorities  now  it turns out  in some cities  germans themselves are the minority  and itâ€™s sometimes easier to build a mosque than a church  above all  the migrants are restive  and  now  some of us understand that they were a latent serious challenge to us  the struggle for influence within german society has already begun  nevertheless  we should not blame only the newcomers  the fact is they faced a closed society  germans still have strong national feelings  they support their own  and wonâ€™t give others a hand up  not only turks or arabs  but also russian or ukrainians  find it difficult to obtain work in germany  this is quite unlike france  where arabs  mainly moroccans and algerians  were acceptable from the very beginning  after the second world war  they came into the country with french passports  moreover  thereâ€™s no concept of a â€œleading cultureâ€ in germany  the same thing is true with pakistanis and indians in england  migrants there are an imperial heritage  which is not the case in our situation  in germany  there are migrant workers  unskilled workers  who wonâ€™t assimilate into our society  the authorities clearly donâ€™t know what to do about it  in this case  the current generation of politicians are simply not capable of taking the tough measures the situation calls for  18 october 2010 marina aleshina izvestiya      izvestia ru obshestvo article3147377  comments off blog stats 7 722 415 hits december 2010 m t w t f s s Â« nov Â  jan Â» Â  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17

deedsâ€¦ life is soÂ short!â€ filed under: christian   elders   moscow patriarchate   orthodox life â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 hereâ€™s a vid on solovkiâ€¦ the chantâ€™s pretty goodâ€¦ editorâ€™s foreword: with all the news coming out on the sleazoids amongst the clergy  letâ€™s look at the â€œgood guysâ€ tooâ€¦ theyâ€™re the ones who keep the church alive and sweet  the last real elders we had in russian orthodoxy in america were archimandrite vladimir sukhobok and fr michael pomazansky (the great refuter of schmemannâ€¦ i find it interesting that this major figure has no orthowiki pageâ€¦ that proves this websiteâ€™s acrid konvertsy orientation) (both men died in 1988  by the way)  priest friends abroad inform that there is only one elder in america today (none of the oca or aocana poseurs even come close)â€¦ archimandrite ephraim of philotheou  whose monastic roots are on the mountain  there are no elders in western europe  nor have there ever been in our days  hereâ€™s a spread on one of the truly holy ones of our timeâ€¦ fr zosima  pray for us sinners  especially this one! bmd ****** ****** the late schema archimandrite zosima sokur (1944 2002) was one of the elders of the early days of the late 20th century orthodox revival in russia  when he died  all of his spiritual children were bereft and sad  ****** ****** hereâ€™s what i wrote about elder zosima: he was so young when he diedâ€¦ he was only 58! of course  when one is 56â€¦ ouch  life is so fragile  isnâ€™t it? the good lord has given me good healthâ€¦ maybe little else  but good health is a precious gift  and i wouldnâ€™t trade it for all the money in the world  ****** ****** â€œ[ukrainian president] vladimir yanukovich was converted by the clairvoyant elder zosima  who then married him to his long term partnerâ€  an mp priest ****** ****** be in a hurry to do good deedsâ€¦ life is so short  may your guardian angel be with all of youâ€¦ schema archimandrite zosima sokur ****** ****** hereâ€™s a link to good stuff on elder zosima:    orthodoxengland org uk frzosima htm no  virginia  not all the clergy are ferapontsâ€¦ not all are cut from the same bolt of sleazy cloth as lebedeff and garklavs are  there are holy men walking amongst usâ€¦ would all of you say a prayer and light a candle for nickyâ€™s cousin denise (dionisia)? she truly needs it  dear ones  i weepâ€¦

i think that  lately  people donâ€™t dress  but  more correctly  they â€œundressâ€  in general  fashion dictates abandoned and promiscuous behaviours Â i think that women shout out their sexual insecurities through their choice of clothes Â it screams out in the cut of their dresses  everything is disclosed to the senses in a rather vulgar manner Â in men  i donâ€™t like it when they try to imitate gays  shirts open far too much  flip flops on bare feet  belts at half mast  why  you can see their undies! iâ€™m not a goody two shoes  and iâ€™m not a reactionary  but i simply believe that such things arenâ€™t beautiful or stylish  theyâ€™re not even sexy  theyâ€™re just depraved Â iâ€™m a person who loves fashionâ€¦ iâ€™m not a grouchy baba  condemning the young for what they did themselves in their youth Â i have an open mind; iâ€™ve travelled halfway around the world  and iâ€™ve an idea or two about fashion and beauty Â thatâ€™s why i think i have the right to criticise these trends Â many girls who buy fashionable and supposedly sexy stuff donâ€™t even notice how the only thing that it does is to emphasise the flaws of their shapes  real men  i believe  wonâ€™t wear thongs  tight fitting slacks  and flip flops on their bare feet  itâ€™s simply not a normal style for real men  who  unfortunately for us women  are getting fewer and fewer Â in short  our fashion lacks culture and taste  viktoria pierre marie ****** nkeiruka (kira ) khilarievna ezekh (1983  )  international master of sport and software engineer                                she has been on three olympic curling teams (2002  2006  2010)  twice all russia curling champion (1999  2001)  and european champion in 2006  her father is nigerian  and her mother is from the turkic chuvash people (who are mostly orthodox christians)  iâ€™m an ordinary russian girlâ€¦ with a few added features Â my dad was nigerian; he studied at moscow state university Â he met my mum  who was an engineering student  at a party Â between them  a romance grew up; i really donâ€™t know the details of it all Â when i wasnâ€™t even a year old  my father received his diploma and returned to nigeria  and my mother didnâ€™t go with him because she had to care for me Â soon afterwards  we lost contact with him Â later  when we moved into a new apartment  we sent him a letter  but we received no reply  apparently  he also changed his address  iâ€™ve never been to africa Â true  my mother and i holidayed in the canary islands  which are near africa  but  besides that  the closest iâ€˜ve been is in italy Â previously  i wanted to communicate with my father  but now  heâ€™s probably lost for good Â i never really lived with him  and i donâ€™t remember him  there was only a picture on the piano of when i was baptisedâ€¦ a lot of people  many of them were africans  too  students  like my dad  nkeiruka (kira ) khilarievna ezekh ****** emilia halsberievna turey (1984  )  silver medallist at the 2008 beijing olympics in handballâ€¦                                thereâ€™s more of course  but thereâ€™s only so much length that i allot myselfâ€¦ if itâ€™s too long  you wonâ€™t read it  thereâ€™s oliver golden and the 16 black american agronomists who revolutionised cotton farming in uzbekistanâ€¦ james patterson  the son of a black american actor living in the ussr  who became a naval officer and poetâ€¦ emilia turey  the champion handball playerâ€¦ and there are many  many more  is there trouble with some idiot racists today in russia? yesâ€¦ they came in with the troubles that the americans imported in the 90s  as i said earlier  both church and state are working together to face this sicknessâ€¦ quite unlike the usa  where the republican party provides a safe haven for open and unashamed racists (it took in strom thurmond with no questions asked and with no hesitation)  weâ€™ll get things back to snuff in the rodina   no doubt  donâ€™t forgetâ€¦ orthodoxy hates all forms of bigotry and racismâ€¦ hmmâ€¦ does that mean that the konvertsy who are trying to contaminate the church with their tea party nastiness are wrong? yes  they certainly are! we should emulate the mother church and fight racism in all of its formsâ€¦ if we donâ€™t  we arenâ€™t of christ  thatâ€™s all there is to say  you can have his holiness and the proper worship of the lord christâ€¦ or  you can have rush limbaugh and the naked and overt adoration of mammon  ye cannot worship both god and mammon â€¦ donâ€™t forget that  bmd share this: share twitter email stumbleupon reddit facebook digg linkedin print like this: like loading    related comments off blog stats 7 722 153 hits january 2011 m t w t f s s Â« dec Â  feb Â» Â  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Â  archives select month may 2014 Â (67) april 2014 Â (185) march 2014 Â (166) february 2014 Â (125) january 2014 Â (125) december 2013 Â (107) november 2013 Â (90) october 2013 Â (146) september 2013 Â (156) august 2013 Â (50) july 2013 Â (120) june 2013 Â (96) may 2013 Â (120) april 2013 Â (97) march 2013 Â (141) february 2013 Â (117) january 2013 Â (105) december 2012 Â (136) november 2012 Â (215) october 2012 Â (220) september 2012 Â (282) august 2012 Â (210) july 2012 Â (175) june 2012 Â (181) may 2012 Â (211) april 2012 Â (148) march 2012 Â (129) february 2012 Â (175) january 2012 Â (184) december 2011 Â (174) november 2011 Â (189) october 2011 Â (165) september 2011 Â (125) august 2011 Â (147) july 2011 Â (156) june 2011 Â (83) may 2011 Â (97) april 2011 Â (106) march 2011 Â (197) february 2011 Â (145) january 2011 Â (186) december 2010 Â (180) november 2010 Â (123) october 2010 Â (112) september 2010 Â (111) august 2010 Â (144) july 2010 Â (174) june 2010 Â (85) may 2010 Â (106) april 2010 Â (64) march 2010 Â (77) february 2010 Â (61) january 2010 Â (116) december 2009 Â (141) november 2009 Â (104) october 2009 Â (50) september 2009 Â (15) august 2009 Â (1) july 2009 Â (7) june 2009 Â (4) april 2009 Â (1) march 2009 Â (6) february 2009 Â (69) january 2009 Â (112) december 2008 Â (91) november 2008 Â (78) october 2008 Â (124) september 2008 Â (96) august 2008 Â (353) july 2008 Â (245) june 2008 Â (236) may 2008 Â (174) april 2008 Â (131) march 2008 Â (140) february 2008 Â (110) january 2008 Â (84) december 2007 Â (83) november 2007 Â (73) blogroll a daily column on painting by lisa towers and bill jonesâ€¦ very good site maintained by two working artists with grubby grubbies 0 art and faith  too: a more general art site (started 06 10) 0 art and faith: a site with primo russian art imagesâ€¦ the place for russian artâ€¦ from aivazovsky to zaitsevâ€¦ and just about everybody in between 0 art in faithâ€¦ with a focus narrowly on iconography per seâ€¦ 0 voices from russia  too: a more image driven site 0 search for: categories select category abortionÂ Â (23) alaskaÂ Â (70) andrei kuraevÂ Â (37) andrew phillipsÂ Â (16) animalsÂ Â (302) archbishop vikenty of yekaterinburgÂ Â (28) archimandrite tikhon shevkunovÂ Â (19) architectureÂ Â (38) art musicÂ Â (171) athos athonite monksÂ Â (40) balletÂ Â (48) baltic statesÂ Â (42) barack obamaÂ Â (379) belarusÂ Â (37) biographyÂ Â (175) breaking newsÂ Â (272) buddhistÂ Â (12) businessÂ Â (161) canadaÂ Â (143) carpatho russianÂ Â (114) children s storiesÂ Â (17) chinaÂ Â (204) christianÂ Â (3 994) christmasÂ Â (253) church in societyÂ Â (1 107) church stateÂ Â (551) cinemaÂ Â (85) civil unrestÂ Â (436) computers & cyberworldÂ Â (6) confessionÂ Â (13) convert narrativesÂ Â (23) culturalÂ Â (586)

http://02varvara.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/22-january-2011-some-of-my-favourite-things/
22 january 2011  some of my favourite thingsâ€¦ | voices from russia voices from russia saturday  22 january 2011 22 january 2011  some of my favouriteÂ thingsâ€¦ filed under: animals   christian   moscow patriarchate   orthodox life   religious   russian â€” 01varvara @ 00 00 editorâ€™s foreword: iâ€™ve received a good response from my some of my favourite things post that i put up today  therefore  hereâ€™s a reprise of an item that i posted over two years ago  itâ€™s one of my personal faves  fr serapion has a point to make  and he makes it well  my belief is that we shouldnâ€™t anthropomorphise animals  but  on the other hand  we should remember that the beasts are godâ€™s creatures too  and we should act accordingly  bmd ****** hieromonk serapion mitko  the head of the diocese of yaroslavl missionary department  whose house was set on fire by unknown arsonists late last week  saved his three little kittens from the fire  as he told ourÂ  interfax religion correspondent  he bought the kittens just a few days before the accident  â€œwhen the walls started burning  the kittens were sleeping in the kitchen rolled into a multicoloured ball  as usual  as i was leaving the house  i asked my driver to get them out of the house  i wouldnâ€™t be able to live with myself if those little critters had perished in the fireâ€  fr serapion said  then  he remembered the words of antoine de st exupÃ©ry  â€œyou are responsible  forever  for what you have tamedâ€  and godâ€™s instructions to adam to preserve this world and all the animals he had named  â€œiâ€™ve always reflected upon the theological status of animals  we know that everything that breathes praises the lord  but people canâ€™t understand how these creatures feel the creator  this lack of understanding witnesses to our narrow minds and to the grandeur of godâ€™s mystery of creationâ€  he said  fr serapion  who defended a thesis on ethics for his theological degree  reflected that one of the fundamental ethical problems is the suffering of animals  â€œwe know that human suffering may help a person to achieve moral purification  but  we donâ€™t know why animals suffer  from our human standpoint  the suffering of animals is senseless  which makes it even more terribleâ€  he believes  fr serapion called to mind the words of russian poet marina tsvetayeva that the lord didnâ€™t exile animals from paradise; they just followed man out of the garden  he is convinced that â€œthey live in quite a different dimension  where sin hasnâ€™t penetrated yet or penetrates only through our fault  if we  people  expose animals to suffering through our sins  then  we must save them  we should treat animals in the same way we treat people  so that people wouldnâ€™t treat each other like animalsâ€  3 december 2008 interfax religion      interfax religion ru ?act=news&div=27601 editorâ€™s afterword: we should treat animals in the same way we treat people  so that people wouldnâ€™t treat each other like animals  that makes me think of the recent shenanigans of whiteford and lebedeff on a certain internet forum  it was on a par with the actions of velencia and karlgut  just why are priests of the church â€œtreating people like animals?â€ if this isnâ€™t a sign of advanced rot  i donâ€™t know what it is Â we have a church to rebuildâ€¦ but we canâ€™t do it until we remove the squatters camping in the ruins of the old oca and rocor  after all the nastiness of the church war in the 70s and 80s  after all the accusations that they hurled at one another  today  we can see that its main protagonists were identical under the skinâ€¦ â€œwe few are going to tell you many what to doâ€¦ and you shall not complainâ€¦ we are the gatekeepers to the church  and if you displease us we shall plague you until you leaveâ€ Â i think that thereâ€™s something horridly wrong with this pictureâ€¦ i seem to think that most of you agree with me! bmd share this: share twitter

member directory discussion lists (listserv) gift membership forgot your member id password? member testimonials albert allen bartlett  emeritus member: over the years  aapt has meant a great deal to me both professionally and socially   throughout my 62 years of membership i have really benefited from the opportunity to interact with great physics teachers  both formally and informally   the annual meetings have always been a highlight of the year for me and i regret that i am not able to get out as much now as i did years ago   david r  sokoloff  aapt president  2011:   while the decision to join aapt in the early 1970s came easily for me  i understand that today s economic realities are somewhat different   and one might ask  "what does aapt do for me?"  however  dues are modest by any standards  and shouldn t the question really be  "what does aapt do for the physics teaching profession  and for our students?" through ptra (winner of the 2011 aps excellence in physics education award) and the new ementoring program for enhancement of in service high school teachers  skills  through phystec for the recruitment and training of new teachers  through our peer reviewed journals—the american journal of physics and the physics teacher —and through compadre  providing essential resources at all levels  through new faculty workshops  providing research based strategies to new college level faculty  and through student programs like the u s  physics olympiad team  aapt continues to enrich our diverse membership   and  aapt is the one organization that represents the interests of all physics teachers at the national level  for example  to the national science foundation and to congress  ( the physics teacher   february 2011) beth a  cunningham  aapt executive officer:   if you have a passion for physics education and want to be a part of the movement to improve the understanding of physics then aapt is the association for you  don freeland  michigan high school teacher:   i have enjoyed my association with the american association of physics teachers  it has been very instrumental in my growth and development  mentoring is a big part and i ve had the opportunity to be mentored by a very much larger group of mentors by being at the meetings and interacting with master teachers in just about every type of situation  they come from large high schools  small high schools  and university settings  tod leiff  cloud community college: coming to the national meeting is a valuable experience  i have lots of people who are two year college mentors and other people who are mentors   all these people are aapt members who are also distinguished service citation award and millikan medal winners   those are the people i really lean on and have taken a lot of advice from   aapt has been really great for me and my professional development   it has really helped my career  gordon ramsey  loyola university: when i come to the aapt meetings i always come back rejuvinated and with great ideas   even though i am doing some administrative things i aways find the ideas that i get from aapt that apply to my teaching and my department s activities and curriculum so very valuable  marie f  plumb  jamestown community college: aapt has defined who i am in the physics community and i am forever grateful for what it had done for me  john hubisz  north carolina state university:   the organization can fulfill the needs of all physics teachers and those who would like to become physics teachers   sometimes i m asked about the cost of membership   stop and think of what you learn   this is something that is going to be beneficial to you for the rest of your career   the investment  though it might sound like a lot today  is an investment in your future   it will be difficult to judge the return that you get from being a member of aapt  elizabeth (tommi) holsenbeck  alabama state university:   i joined aapt in january of my first year of teaching when i was 40   i started reading the physics teacher and went to workshops   whether through workshops or other people that i ve met  i ve grown and grown   now i m lucky enough to be in charge of the high school physics photo contest   i m excited about all the pictures   i think this is a great way for aapt to share how high schools and high school students look at physics  nina daye  orange high school: my training was originally in biology but i was hired to teach physics   aapt has been an important part of my professional development   one of the strengths of this organization is that people work together  people collaborate  and you are not just stuck out there by yourself   even though you might be the only physics teacher is a school  you don t have to be alone   i can send an email to my friends and get an answer the next day  find out abut new pedagogy  or look at cutting edge technology   my use of microcomputer based labs all came from aapt as i learned about them at conferences or in the literature   this organization has meant so much to me in terms of making me who i am as a person and as a physics teacher  harvey s  leff  california polytec (retired):  aapt has been  and continues to be  an important part of my life and career  it has helped me improve my teaching and network with other physics teachers  it provides vehicles (ajp and tpt) for keeping up to date on the new ideas of others and publishing my own work  shawn reeves  energy teachers org:  aapt makes me a better teacher  but it s more complicated than that  aapt provides a forum not only for improvement but questioning our practice  helping us identify a need at an aapt meeting  that openness inspired me and two other teachers to start energyteachers org  and i go back to aapt every year for new inspirations  jon anderson  centennial senior high school: i am a hs physics teacher and have participated in numerous professional development activities throughout my career  the best pd that i receive is a direct result of my membership in aapt  the publication "the physics teacher" is a wealth of ideas and inspiration and something that i read thoroughly and i look forward to the opportunity to attend professional meetings sponsored by aapt and the information that i learn at them  john l  roeder  calhoun school: after i received the excellence in pre college teaching award from the american association of physics teachers (aapt) in 2003  i was asked what advice i would give new teachers  after about ten minutes of thought  i realized that the answer was simple: "join aapt!" why? because most of what has helped me to improve as a physics teachers has come from aapt workshops and aapt meetings  aapt is a great forum for physics teachers at all levels to interact and improve the teaching of physics  i couldn t imagine being a physics teacher without it  kevin doyle  morris hills high school:   aapt has helped me in so many ways  it has given me many experiences  teaching ideas  and physics knowledge that i have used to make myself a better teacher  more importantly  my students have recieved better instruction because of aapt and how they have shaped my teahing and understanding of physics  joe spaccavento  north arlington high school: i am a proud aapt member of 30 years  as a physics educator  aapt is the guardian for physics education around the globe  i have been active on the national  state  and local level providing and receiving valuable teacher training    this incredible organization has helped to mold me into the educational leader i am today  physics teachers are special people  they are a true learning community of dedicated professionals    the aapt is the backbone which supports all of the various sections of aapt which in turn service the those teachers who might not have the opportunity to attend a national meeting  i serve as the new jersey section representative and wear my

school physics and physical science teachers across the us   all gifts to this fund will be used to train ptras to provide professional development to their peers   make your gift online   the american association of physics teachers (aapt) initiated the physics teaching resource agents (ptra) program in 1985—with support from the national science foundation (nsf) —with the mission of improving the teaching and learning of physics and physical science for all teachers and students in the united states  aapt ptra is the leading in service physics professional development program  it is effective for middle school and high school teachers  it provides professional development on physics content  teaching techniques based on research in physics education  and integration of technology into curriculum the program maintains a nationwide cadre of more than 150 accomplished high school teacher leaders who are trained and continually involved in professional development  these teacher leaders are certified as ptras by aapt to lead workshops throughout the country  these 150 experienced ptras have participated in national leadership institutes where they have developed their skills on a wide range of topics—to assist their fellow teachers  the program has involved more than 30 universities and college physics departments partnering to provide the summer institutes and follow up sessions  potential national ptras are selected based on physics content mastery  creativity  successful teaching experience  familiarity with physics education research  and the capacity for professional leadership   the opportunity for continuity and expansion of training is offered each year at an intense summer institute at which aapt ptra commissioned workshops are developed  what emerges  then  are teachers from within urban districts or rural schools who go out to meet the specific needs of teachers in their local area  front l r: karen jo matsler  larry badar  jan mader back l r: george amann  jim nelson  robert clark the ptra program was awarded the 2011 aps excellence in physics education award   the award recognizes and honors a team or group of individuals (such as a collaboration)  or exceptionally a single individual  who have exhibited a sustained commitment to excellence in physics education  because it matters  our program goals are ambitious: to provide all physics teachers the opportunity to continue growing professionally and become not just competent  but creative and effective in their teaching  to identify outstanding leader teachers  tap them as ptras  and engage them in the annual summer national leadership institutes  to develop print and electronic resources and modules designed to serve not only as workshop resources but also as long term references for practicing teachers  to be recognized as a leading provider of accessible  high quality in service programs in physics and physical science for pre
